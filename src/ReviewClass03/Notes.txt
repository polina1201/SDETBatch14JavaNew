Logical Operators:
Logical operators help us test more than one condition. In java we have && as the AND operator and || OR operator and ! NOT.
Why we should learn about Logical Operators?
	Logical operators help us reduce the number of if-conditions that we write in certain cases.

What is the Syntax?
	
	If(condition1 && condition2) {
Shout “Hello”;  }
If(condition1) {
	If (condition2) {
Shout “Hello”;
}
}

Switch case:
	Similar to "if else if" conditions

Why we should learn about the switch case?
	it's cleaner code
	It's faster than if-conditions
