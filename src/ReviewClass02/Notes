Type casting:
	Converting the type of data from one type into another type.
	2 Types of type casting.
		1. Explicit/Narrowing/Manual - When we go from a bigger data type to a smaller
		2. Implicit/Widening/Automatic - When we go from a smaller data type to a larger data type
		
	Data Types:
		Byte = 8 (can only hold 8 bits)
		Short = 16 (can only hold 16 bits)
		char = 16 (can only hold 16 bits)
		int = 32 (can only hold 32 bits)
		long = 64 (can hold 64 bits)
		float = 32 (can hold decimals and store larger numbers 32.E12 is 32*100000)
		double = 64 
		
	Why we need Type Casting?
		When we are working in teams we might need to convert data from  different data types. When we are working 
		with math sometime we need to get rid of decimal part as we are only interested in the non-decimal part.
	
	What is the Syntax?
		Explicit/Narrowing/Manual
			int box = 1000;
			byte box2 = (byte) box
		Implicit/widening/Automatic
		short box1=250;
		int box2=box1;
====================================================================================
If Statements:
	If else conditions allow us to write programs that can take decision based on 
	some condition and provided data
	
	If condition =>
	If else condition =>
	If else if condition =>
	nested if else condition=>
	
Why we should learn about "if else" condition?
	When we are solving real life problems, like testing a web site, our program needs to make a lot of decision.

What is the Syntax of "if else" conditions?
	if condition
		boolean rich=true;
		if (rich)
		{System.out.println("Lets buy a boat");
		 }
