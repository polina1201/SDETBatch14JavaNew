Type Casting (primitive data types):
	Type casting is converting one data type to another one
	For ex., we can convert a short to byte, a long to float, etc.,
	There are two main types implicit/widening/automatic and explicit/narrowing/Manual
Implicit/widening/automation Type casting:
	When java converts the data types automatically for us. It only happens hen we assign 
	a smaller data type to a larger data type, because there is no data loss in this Conversion.
Explicit/narrowing/Manual Type casting:
	When we convert a larger data type to a smaller data type it is called
	Explicit/narrowing/Manual. It doesn't happen automatically, we have to do it explicitly/Manually.
Why we should learn type casting?
	When we write code in our real life, most of the time we use the code from others to save time. 
	We might also need to convert the data types to make our code compatible with their code.
What is the syntax for type casting?
	We use ()and inside the () we write the destination data type, for example if we want to convert
	a long to an int, this is how we can do it:
	long var1=250;
	int var2=(int)var1; // it's Explicit/narrowing/Manual
	double var3=var2  //Implicit/widening/automatic
	
	float f+250.5f
	double d=f;//Implicit/widening/automatic

If else conditions
		If else conditions help us write a code that can take the decision based on data.
Why we should learn about if else?
		Because when we are solving a real life problem like testing a Website, our 
		Programs need to make a lot of decisions.
		IF (the given username and password matches)
		{go to home page} ELSE {give user a warning}.
		
		if (video freezing) {
		System.out.println("Stop video")}
		else {
		System.out.println("Keep Video")}

What is the syntax for If else conditions
	boolean isHungry=true;
	
	if(isHungry) {
	System.out.println("Please Eat something");
	}else {
	systme.out.println("Lets build some java programs")}
