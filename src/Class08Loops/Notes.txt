Java Class 08

Loops in Java:

	while
	do while
	for
	enhanced for loop/for each loop/advanced for loop

	for loop - when we know number of repetitions/iterations in advance

	for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement){
		code to repeat;
	}

	while loop and do while ->if we don't know number of repetitions

		WHILE VS DO WHILE:

while checks condition first -> then executes code
do while executes code then checks the condition

	while(boolean condition) {
		code to repeat;
		}

	do {

	}while(boolean condition);

	------------------------

Nested Loops - loop inside another loop

for (int i=1; i<3; i++){ -->outer loop

System.out.println("Hello);

for (int j=1; j<=3; j++){ -->nested loop
System.out.println("Bye");

}
}
