FileHandling in Java
    Reading, writing and manipulating files using Java code.
Why should we learn FileHandling:
    1) When we perform data driven testing, we need to store data in files
    2) Storing critical data like Usernames and passwords inside the code is bad and not secure. When we push the code
    to Github, that info will also be pushed with it. To avoid, we use properties files.
    3) Sometimes data can be large in GBs, and it's a bad practice to push GBs to Github
How can we read data from a file?
    1) First we need to know the location(path) of the file
    2) Navigate to that location where file is stored
    3) We need a special class/Software that can help us read/write to that file.
