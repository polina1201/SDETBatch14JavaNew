Collections Framework:
    is a set of classes and interfaces that help use, store, and manipulate data.
Why we need collections framework?
    1) Flexibility
    2) Ready-Made Methods
    3) Same classes and methods can be used with different datatype
Some common classes:
    1) ArrayList
    2) LinkedList
    3) HashSet
    4) LinkedHashSet
    5) TreeSet
Some common Interfaces:
    1) List
    2) Set
List:
    1) Lists like ArrayList and LinkedList mainatins the insertion order
    2) They allow duplicates
Set:
    1) They do not allow duplicate values.

ArrayList vs LinkedList:
    When most of the time we retrieve the data, we should use an ArrayList. It's very fast to retrieve
    index-based data because underlying datastructure is an array.
    When most of the time we manipulate the data (adding/removing/shifting add(),set(), remove())

    loops
    arrays
    String class
    maps
    ArrayList

HasSet vs LinkedHashSet vs TreeSet
    We should always go with the HashSet. It's the fastest of 3 and requires less memory.
    If order is important, we should use LinkedHashSet.
    TreeSet - elements are sorted according to the natural order of its elements, in ascending order

Maps:
Whenever we have to store key value, pairs for example, or items and their prices, we should use Maps.
A map contains values on the basis of key, i.e. key and value pair. Each key and value pair is known as an entry.
