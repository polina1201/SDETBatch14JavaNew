Maps in Java:
    Maps are data structures that allow us to store key value pairs. it's interface we can store Key and value
Why we should use Maps?
    Whenever we have to store key value pairs, instead of using arrays or 2D arrays or ArrayLists, we should use Maps.
    They provide very good performance and have built-in methods to process the data.
What is the syntax of Maps?
    Map<DataTypeOfKey, DataType Of Value> anyName=new MapCalss<>();
    for example, if we have to store fruit and their prices, we will do something like this:
    HashMap<String, Double> fruit-new HashMap<>();
 Types of Maps:
 1)HashMaps 2) LinkedHashMap 3) TreeMap

 HashMap:
    This is the most widely used type of map. It's the fastest and occupies less memory.
    We should always use HashMap if there are no requirements for insertion order or sorting.

 LinkedHashMap:
    LinkedHashMap keeps the insertion order, but it takes a little more memory than HashMap and is a little slower.

 TreeMap:
    TreeMap sorts the data in natural order, but insertion is very slow. It takes more memory to keep the data in sorted order.
    Alphabetizes the order (A-Z, 1-10)

 FileHandling:
    Reading, writing data to files with the help of java is called file handling
 Steps to read data from any files on any computer:
    1) we need location of file on our computer
    2) we need to go to that location
    3) we need a software that can read and write data to that file. Ex. Need Excel if we want to work with xlsx file
