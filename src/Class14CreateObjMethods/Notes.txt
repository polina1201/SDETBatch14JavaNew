String Methods:
    String is the most widely used class in Java. We can use it to store text based data.

    StringBuffer and StringBuilder is exactly the same. Buffer was first and then Builder was created.
        They have exact same features and used interchangeably.
        Builder - Mostly used class; newer, better, faster
        Buffer - Older, slower, and not used as often

    To reverse - need to use StringBuilder, cannot reverse a String. if you want to reverse a String, need to reverse
     String to StringBuilder.

Methods in Java:
    Method in Java is simply a block of code or some Java Statements put together in a block.
