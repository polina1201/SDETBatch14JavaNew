		 * Casting is converting one data type to another data type
		 * Why learn about type casting? - to use the code that is already written by someone else to make our life easier
		 * or when we will be working in teams, we will be able to merge the code.
		 * What is the Syntax for type casting? - when we are converting something smaller to larger, we don't need to do anything,
		 * it happens automatically. We just assign the variable, for example: 
		 * 
		 * int box=1234: 
		 * long box2=box; //this is how it works and it's called implicit or widening or automatic
		 * 
		 * However, when we convert a larger data type to a smaller data type, then we do it (not automatic).
		 * 
		 * long box=1245454;
		 * int box2=(int) box; // this is called narrowing or explicit or manual conversion
		 * 
		 *
