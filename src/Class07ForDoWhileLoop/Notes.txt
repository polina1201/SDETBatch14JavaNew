Java Class 7

Switch Syntax

switch(variable) {

case value1:
	codeA;
	break;
case value2:
	code B;
	break;
default:
	code C;
	break;
}

Limitations:
	data types: CANNOT work with double, long, float,
	CANNOT use logical operators and relational operators

Loops -

	System.out.println("good morning");
	System.out.println("good morning");
	System.out.println("good morning");
	System.out.println("good morning");
	System.out.println("good morning");
	System.out.println("good morning");

	int time=10;

	if (time<12) {

	System.out.println("good morning");
	}

	while(time<12){

	System.out.println("good morning");

	}

While Loop Syntax

	while(boolean condition) {
		code to be repeated}

Do While Loop

do while loop syntax

do{
	code to be repeated;
} while (boolean condition);

While vs Do While -> both loops executed while condition is true

While loop first CHECKS condition->if true->executes code
Do While first EXECUTES code -> then checks condition



For Loop Syntax

for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement){
code to be repeated;

}
//Hello 5 times

for(int i=1; i<=5; i++) {
System.out.prin("hello");
}

When to use which loop:

	When we know in advance how many times to repeat block of code -> USE for LOOP
	When we do not know in advance how many times to repeat block of code -> USE while OR do while LOOP
