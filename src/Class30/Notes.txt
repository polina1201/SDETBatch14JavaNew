Exception:
    Exceptions are unwanted behaviours which occur during runtime and can terminate programs abruptly or
    can change the normal behaviour of a program.
Why should we handle exceptions?
    1) When we handle exceptions, it leads to a very good user experience.
    2) We can read the error messages and can figure what we are doing wrong
    3) When we handle the exceptions properly, only the problematic code will not execute, the rest of the code
        will still continue to work
