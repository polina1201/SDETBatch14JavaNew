Loops:
	Loops in Java help us execute a piece of code over and over again.
	int x=0;
	sys x;
	
Why we should learn about loops?
	Because loops help us write cleaner and scalable code. For example, if you have 
	to test a password field on a webpage, you can create different variation of data 
	in an excel sheet, then you pick all the values one by one and test the field.
	
Syntax Loops - 4 main types of loops:
	for Loop
	while Loop
	do while Loop
	enhanced for Loop
	
Syntax "for" Loop
	for loop
	for(starting point; ending point; step size){
	code that we want to repeat
	}
	
	Every while loop can be replaced with For loop
	
	All the loops are interchangeable, but sometimes using the on type of loop can make your code
	cleaner and easier to understand
