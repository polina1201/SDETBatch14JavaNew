What is an Object?
	Everything around us is an object. For example, keyboard, mouse, glass, etc.
	Objects can be defined based on how they look and how they behave.
	Objects in computer programming are also very similar. They have state (which helps us define
	how that object looks like)and behavior (what that object does).
What is Class:
	Class is blueprint/design/template from which we create the objects

Object oriented programming:
	Is just a way of writing programs
Why we should learn OOP?
	1) It simplifies the development of large programs
	2) It will also help us maintain and modify the existing code
	3) It helps us write more secure code
	4) It helps us avoid duplicate code
